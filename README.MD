# ACNH API

### Updated for 1.3.0 (Summer Update 1)

### Introduction:

ACNH API is a **free RESTful API** for **furniture**, **critters**, **fossils**, **art**, **music** and **villagers** from Animal Crossing: New Horizons.

This started for me as a little side project for me but ended up getting much attraction than I ever thought it would get (~1 400 000 requests per day).

The API is free and without authentification to make it easy for anyone to start developing on a subject they like.

If any of the information on the website is wrong or outdated, you can either contact me on Discord (Alexis#8717) or make a pull request on this repository.

Buy me a [coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/acnhapi) or donate directly through [PayPal](https://paypal.me/acnhapi) and help contribute toward the server costs to keep this service free!

### Changelog:
See [CHANGELOG.MD](https://github.com/alexislours/ACNHAPI/blob/master/CHANGELOG.MD).

### Usage:

All the JSON data from this API is under MIT license, the images and music assets are the sole property of Nintendo.

The data can be obtained as an object array instead of a nested JSON by doing requests on `https://acnhapi.com/v1a/` instead of `https://acnhapi.com/v1/`.

The documentation for the API can be found [here](https://acnhapi.com/doc).

No authentification is required to make requests to any of the endpoints which can be accessed over HTTP or HTTPS.
