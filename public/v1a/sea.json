But those aren't the chambered nautilus's only bragging rights. This cephalopod can have up to 90 tentacles, it's said! These arms come coated with a sticky substance that helps the nautilus capture its prey...Which is far better than using them for overly long hugs, I say."

Though they can grow up to 12 feet from claw to claw and weigh up to 40 pounds, they're said to be docile. In fact, these gentle giants love to hide, attaching seaweed and sponges to their shell as camouflage. My feathers, if only I could unsee the SPIDER in the spider crab... I'm sure I'd find it charming as can be."

I daresay Venus' flower basket is one of nature's most impressive works of art."
