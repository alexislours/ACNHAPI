Consequently, their bodies are never preserved as fossils, and questions about their jaws remain unanswered. The size and placement in the stone of the shark's teeth are actually the only things we have to work with. Sometimes in research we must maintain a stiff upper lip, even in the absence of a stiff lower jaw!"

    "museum-phrase": "As herbivores go, Triceratops was unusually well equipped for combat, wot! Its three horns and impressive, bony frill probably helped it fight off predators like T. Rex! The frill may also have been involved in temperature regulation, or else in attracting mates. Does it seem to you like virtually all distinctive dinosaur features were for body heat or attracting mates?"

They were also one of the most successful classes of animal ever, existing for over 300 million years. Some 50,000 species have been identified in sizes ranging from three millimeters to over two feet! Alas, that is the very limit of my enthusiasm for them, though, they look rather too much like bugs."
