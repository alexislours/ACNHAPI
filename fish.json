Unlike many of their kin in the shark family, whale sharks are nonviolent, eating only plankton and such. They grow slowly and live long, relaxed lives of filter feeding and leisure in warm waters. So if you ever have to choose a fish as a roommate, you could do worse than the whale shark. Unless you can't swim."

I imagine this practice is the cause of some awkward conversations between fish and turtle, eh wot"
